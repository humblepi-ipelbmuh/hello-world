# hello-world
+V+

I am the humblebaker.
I would like to learn to code.
I have a very good friend who has a band, and he would like: 
       - some 'swish website' ideas
       - 'rad interactive artwork' for said website
       
Sometimes my friend and I create things together that make sounds and I would like to use my coding knowledge to improve on these creations.

That is all for now.
